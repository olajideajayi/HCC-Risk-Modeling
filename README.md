# HCC-Risk-Modeling

The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) risk adjustment model assigns a risk score, also called the Risk Adjustment Factor or RAF score, to each eligible beneficiary.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's (CMS) Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) risk adjustment model is used to calculate risk scores, which will adjust capitated payments made for aged and disabled beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage (MA) and other plans.

Risk adjustment is a method to offset the cost of providing health insurance for individuals—such as those with chronic health conditions—who represent a relatively high risk to insurers. The risk score is a relative measure of the probable costs to insure the individual.

High scores mean that a patient has more complex and serious conditions and will use more health services, resulting in higher costs in the future. 

The coding assigns a weight to each condition. These weights, combined with demographic factors, determine the HCC score. High scores mean that a patient has more complex and serious conditions and will use more health services, resulting in higher costs in the future.
